Customer Segmentation Using KMeans Clustering

 Project Overview

- Project Name: Customer Segmentation Using KMeans Clustering
- Name: Athul Krishna
- Company: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS
- ID: CT08DS7176
- Domain:Data Analytics
- Duration:Aug to Sep 2024
- Mentor:Santhosh

- Objective:
  The objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation using KMeans clustering to identify distinct groups of customers based on their annual income and spending score. This segmentation will help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer experience.

## Key Activities

- Data Preparation:
  - Loading Data: Extract relevant features (e.g., annual income and spending score) from the customer dataset.
  - Preprocessing: Clean the data and handle any missing values if necessary.

- Feature Selection:
  - Selecting Features: Choose features that are relevant for clustering (e.g., annual income and spending score).

- Model Training:
  - Elbow Method: Determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the Elbow Graph.
  - KMeans Clustering: Fit the KMeans algorithm with the determined number of clusters.

- Model Evaluation:
  - Visualizing Clusters: Plot the clusters and their centroids to visualize the segmentation.
